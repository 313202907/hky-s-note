## Frame里有什么

### A Frame

 - Two Support Element（SE）servers
    In previous z System servers, the SEs were notebooks in the Z Frame. For z13 servers, the SEs are replaced with the 1U servers, which are mounted at the top of the 42U EIA frame. 

 - Two optional intergrated battery features (IBFS)
    Provice the function of a local uninterrupted power source.

 - One PCIe I/O drawer
    Presence of it depends on the server's I/O configuration.

 - Two System Control Hubs (SCHS)
    Replacement of the Bulk Power Hubs that were used in previous z Systems servers.

 - Up to four CPC drawers
    Depends on the model number of the z13 server. Additional ones are filled up from the bottom to the top. 

 - Cooling units
     > We use water-cool
    Two Water Conditioning Units (WCUs) are installed. The WCUs are connected to a customer-operated (data-center) chilled water supply.
